Prevents what's known as a "ghost totem", mostly experienced by high ping players in Crystal PvP

uses Ping packets and delays player death to determine if a player retotemed in time on the client side

NOT FINISHED

while this plugin is in a usable state, it's missing a few things, like proper item stack management when the player unequips their totem and "desync" protection.
this will all be added eventually. I just do not have the time to add it at the moment.
